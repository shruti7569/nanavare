					<h2 class="text-md">Introducing to myself</h2>
					<div class="divider my-4"></div>
					<p>Dr. Rajendra Nanaware is a pulmonologist in Chembur, Mumbai, with 32 years of experience. Dr. Rajendra Nanaware works in Ashirwad Hospital & Polyclinic in Chembur, Mumbai. He earned his MBBS from Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital in Mumbai in 1989, a Diploma in Tuberculosis Diseases (TDD) from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Mumbai in 1995, and a DETRD from the same college in 1998.</p>
					<p>Medical education's ultimate aim is to supply society with a knowledgeable, skilled and up-to-date cadre of professionals who put patient care above self-interest, and undertake to maintain and develop their expertise over the course of a lifelong career. Medicine has a privileged position in society and, as a result, medical education is itself set apart from the main body of higher education. Medical education is education related to the practice of being a medical practitioner, including the initial training to become a physician (i.e., medical school and internship) and additional training thereafter (e.g., residency, fellowship and continuing medical education). Medical education is also the subject-didactic academic field of educating medical doctors at all levels, including entry-level, post-graduate, and continuing medical education. </p>
					<p>My vision in the field of medicine is doctors to be trained in taking proper medical history and physical examination, able to diagnose the illness through clinically and by proper diagnostic and screening tests. Should be able to prescribe the medicine with proper dosage and least adverse effect, proper documentation of case paper for future requirement, able to counsel the patient (Doctor Patient Relationship) and better management of patient. Urgent/Emergency care in any medical emergency, Also Patient handovers/transitions of care while discharging or transferring to higher center. Safety and improvement in every act of treatment or management should be priorities for the benefit of mankind, Postgraduate education for getting skill and good attitude toward the noble profession. Teaching is the best art to develop good physician and to develop skill. Its only way to perpetuate the knowledge to the new generation. </p>

				<p>It is not wrong to earn  money from our profession. but today we see almost all professionals are charging exorbitant amount to their clients and think as an opportunities to earn huge profit. Sometimes we think that they are an unscrupulous human being. 
					But one exceptional person to whom I have been associated with is Dr. Nanaware. One of the best humanitarians I have ever met. He performs his duties selflessly without expecting much from the patients. Several times he provided guidance to me on phone and personal visit too but never asked for the consulting fee. He is such a altruistic person who always prefer to provide services to patients and their relatives. We all know doctor is not less than god. Dr. Nanaware is also one of the amongst those who treat patients with love and compassion and don't treat patient as scapegoat to earn 
					money. I salute Dr. Nanaware and thank you god for giving me an opportunity to be associated with such wonderful person. 
					We all experienced, how hospitals were charging hefty bills to patient by exploiting them during Covid 19. But Dr. Nanaware was incessantly doing his services towards humanity without much expections. 
					I wish and pray god to bestow healthy and peaceful life to Dr. Nanaware.</p>

				<p>डॉ.राजेंद्र ननावरे सर..... आधुनिक संत आहेत त्यांचे बद्दल काय भावना व्यक्त कराव्यात हे समजून घेणं अत्यन्त अवघड गोष्ट आहे. त्यांनी शिवडी येथील महापालिका रुग्णालयात 30 वर्षाहून जास्त काळ गोरगरीब जनतेची सेवा करून क्षयरोग निर्मूलनाचे अविस्मरणीय असे महान काम केले. मुळात त्या ठिकाणी काम करणेस कोणी तयार नसतात. मुळात हे धाडसी पाऊल घेऊन त्यांनी उदयनमुख डॉक्टर यांचेपुढे एक आदर्श ठेवला असे मानावे लागेल. खाजगी प्रॅक्टिस करून त्यांनी अफाट पैसा कमविला असता परंतु तसे न करता त्यांनी आपले संपूर्ण आयुष्य क्षयरोगाचे निर्मूलन  होणे करिता वाहून घेतले. त्याबाबत त्यांचा शासनाने यथोचित गुणगौरव करावा हीच आमची मनोभावना आहे. आजही तें मुंबईतील बकाल झोपडपट्टी परिसरात आपली वैद्यकीय सेवा बजावतात हे गौरास्पद आहे. <br> त्यांचे अखंड सेवेला मानाचा मुजरा. 🙏🙏🌹🌹</p>
